## <a name="Project-Description"></a> Project Description

This project is a classification task, whose purpose is to classify the iris flowers into their respective species based on 
available attributes. The three iris species include Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, and the explanatory variables (attributes) 
include sepal length, sepal width, pedal length and petal width. 

## <a name="Packages-Required"></a> Packages Required

Here are the required libraries to run the code properly:
```
matplotlib
mpl_toolkits
numpy
pandas
scipy
seaborn
sklearn
```

## <a name="Descriptive-Statistics-and-Exploratory-Analysis"></a> Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Analysis 

First, we are going to take a look at the data. The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. 
There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. 
All observed flowers belong to one of the three species (Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica). Specifically, we can see that each class 
has the same number of instances (50 or 33% of the dataset).

We also use some visualizations in order to better understand the relationships between the attributes.

## <a name="Splitting-the-Data-into-Training-and-Testing-Sets"></a> Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Before creating some models of the data, we need to split the dataset into training set and testing set. In this project, 
we used 80% of the data (chosen randomly) to build and train the models and the remaining 20% to assess how well the developed 
algorithms work. That is, we are going to use the training set in order to understand the data, select the appropriate model and 
determine the model parameters, and the testing set, which contains unseen data, in order to get a realistic and more concrete 
estimate of the modelsâ€™ performance.

## <a name="Model-Building"></a> Model Building
Now, we will build and fit some models to the training set and we will estimate their accuracy on the testing set. 
For this purpose, we will build 10 different models: **K-Means Clustering**, **Naive Bayes (NB)**, **Logistic Regression (LR)**,
**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, **Decision Tree (CART)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, **Gradient Boosting Method (GBM)**, 
**k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Neural Network (NN)**.
